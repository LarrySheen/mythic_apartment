> This Requires mythic_instances which has not been released! esx_instance is a good starting point to seeing how an instance script is handled.

NOTE: As with most MythicRP releases at this point, this has several calls to Mythic Framework resources that have not (and may not) released publicly. This is intended as a dev resource at most and not a simple drag & drop to use on public servers. Do not make any issues asking for it to be made to work on a public framework.
